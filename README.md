# Election Analysis

## Project Overview:

An anlysis of a local Colorado Congressional campaign. Results for the following were found using using Python.
  - Total number of votes
  - Name of candidates in the running
  - Total number of votes each candidate received
  - Percentage of the total vote that each candidate received
  - The final winner of the campaign
  
## Resources:

  - Data file: election_results.csv
  - Programs/applications used: Python 3.10.5; Visual Studio Code, Version: 1.68.1
  
## Summary:

The summary of the analysis is as follows:
  - Total number of votes: 
  - Name of candidates in the running:
    * Charles Casper Stockham
    * Diana DeGette
    * Raymon Anthony Doane
  - Total number of votes each candidate received:
    * Charles Casper Stockham received 85,213 votes
    * Diana DeGette received 272,892 votes
    * Raymon Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes
  - Percentage of the total vote that each candidate received:
    * Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the total votes
    * Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the votes
    * Raymon Anthony Doane received 13.1% of the total votes
  - The final winner of the campaign was Diana DeGette.
  
## Overview:

Using the code written here, it would be easy to create an analysis of similarly formatted data of future congressional campaigns. It will streamline this process for the state.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:

  - The indentation and syntax were my most common errors.
  - There were times where my code was out of order and not running properly, but I was able to re-arrange it so that it would no longer be an issue.
