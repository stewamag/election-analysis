# Election Analysis

## Project Overview:

An anlysis of a local Colorado Congressional campaign. Results for the following were found using using Python.
  - Total number of votes
  - The names of the counties performing the vote
  - Total number of votes from each county
  - Percentage of total votes per county
  - Name of county with the highest voter turnout
  - Name of candidates in the running
  - Total number of votes each candidate received
  - Percentage of the total vote that each candidate received
  - The final winner of the campaign
  
## Resources:

  - Data file: election_results.csv
  - Programs/applications used: Python 3.10.5; Visual Studio Code, Version: 1.68.1

The summary of the analysis is as follows:
  - Total number of votes: 369,711
  - The names of the counties performing the vote:
    * Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)

## Overview:

Using the code written here, it would be easy to create an analysis of similarly formatted data of future congressional campaigns. It will streamline this process for the state.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:

  - The indentation and syntax were my most common errors.
  - There were times where my code was out of order and not running properly, but I was able to re-arrange it so that it would no longer be an issue.
